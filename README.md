# AutoFighter
 
 This project is merely a prototype for what is going to be a Unity project.

 Premise of prototype:
 - Enemies spawn in waves. 10 waves total. Finalized with a boss fight.
 - Enemies try to attack gate and player along the way.
 - Player chooses 2 "classes" to swap between during battle.
 - Between waves player can choose upgrade cards.
